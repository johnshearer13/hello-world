There once was a boy from nantucket. 

Nothing really fancy, he just had an odd place of origin.

One would say... that he was found of round objects. 

Who was this "one?" Well, the boy liked to refert to himself as "one" as if he was referring to himself in 3rd person. 

"One" was an odd boy.

And he did like round objects. Balls, rocks. fruits, pretty much anything spherical.
